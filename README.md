## Papers:-
+ [Activations of Deep CNN and visual pathway regions](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/08/29/133694.full.pdf) - how brain regions responsible for visual pathway and the alenet layers capture "similar" features. They compared confusion matrix-type matrices between inputs from diff brain regions and alexnet layers. Uses Representation dissimalirity matrices(RDM) for each layer or probe characteristic ifentification and subsequent Representation similarity analysis(RSA) for quantification of mapping similarity between each probe and each layer of AlexNet.
+ [Convolutional neural network-based encoding and decoding of visual object recognition in space and time](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811917305864?via%3Dihub)
